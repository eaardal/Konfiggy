#Konfiggy

Konfiggy is a tiny helper utility for making life easier when dealing with environment-dependent configuration settings in your app/web.config files.

More info in the Wiki: https://github.com/eaardal/Konfiggy/wiki/_pages

It's still early in development, so use at your own responsibility. At the moment it's not yet in alpha and as such, breaking changes with no respect to backwards-compatibility will occur. Once it's ready for an alpha release, it'll be available on NuGet.

Accepting all kinds of feedback, ideas and/or help :)
